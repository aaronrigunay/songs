Dance Class by Good Kid.
I met you in the yellow light of a sign that bore your name
You said it was a coincidence but one you cant explain
echo Said Im not going to read more of it than I should
But when you smiled, I knew I always would

I wanna meet you in a slow dance
I wanna meet you but its too soon
echo I wanna meet you but I cant speak
Or dare to cross the room

I wanna meet you in a slow dance
I wanna meet you but its too soon
echo I wanna meet you but I cant speak
Or dare to cross the room
But I am trying

Stuck beneath the spinning glow of a familiar hue
Struck by your impression like all of those next to you
But I will try to stand and make it down the hall
But in that sound, Im barely here at all

I wanna meet you in a slow dance
I wanna meet you but its too soon
echo I wanna meet you but I cant speak
Or dare to cross the room

I wanna meet you in a slow dance
I wanna meet you but its too soon
echo I wanna meet you but I cant speak
Or dare to cross the room
But I am trying
So hard
To meet you
Where you are

I wanna meet you in a slow dance
I wanna meet you but its too soon
echo I wanna meet you but I cant speak
Or dare to cross the room

I wanna meet you in a slow dance
I wanna meet you but its too soon
echo I wanna meet you but I cant speaK
Or dare to cross the room
But I am trying so hard
